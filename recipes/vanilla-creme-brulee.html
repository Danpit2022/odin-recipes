    <h1>Vanilla Creme Brulee</h1>
    <img src="../../../odin-links-and-images/images/creme.jpg">
    <p>Smooth, creamy, restaurant-quality creme brûlée only requires 3 ingredients! Make them a few hours or even days before you're planning to serve. Chances are, you won't even need to make a grocery run. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Frozen desserts, ice cream, vanilla </li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Sugars, granulated </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>Preheat the oven to 325°F. In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the ice cream in 20 second intervals, stirring between, until melted. Let the ice cream cool for 5 minutes. Whisk in egg yolks one at a time until the mixture is smooth and consistent. Pour evenly into 2 oven-safe ramekins.</li>
         <li><strong>Step 2</strong>Move the ramekins to a baking dish with a high rim. Pour boiling water into the baking dish until half-way up each ramekin. Bake for 40-50 minutes or until set but still jiggly in the center. Allow to cool completely, then wrap with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge for 2 hours or up to 3 days.</li>
         <li><strong>Step 3</strong>When ready to serve, let the ramekins come to room temperature for 30 minutes, then sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar over each creme brulee. If you have a kitchen blow torch, torch the sugar until golden and bubbly. If you don't, broil on the top rack of the oven at 500°F for 2-3 minutes, watching to make sure they don't burn. Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>

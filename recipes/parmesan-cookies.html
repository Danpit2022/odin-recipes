    <img src="../recipes/parmescan-cookies.jpg">
    <p>These savory cookies are so easy to prepare and call for just 3 ingredients. You can prepare the dough and then refrigerate until ready to bake. Serve with wine as a nibble, or as part of an appetizer spread. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>½ cup salted butter, softened </li>
        <li>1 ⅔ cups grated Parmesan cheese </li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <p><strong>Step 1</strong> </p>

            Mix the flour and butter together. Add Parmesan cheese and work into a solid dough. Form into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li> <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>

                    Roll out chilled dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper to a thickness of 1/8 to 1/4-inch. Use a small cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles. Re-roll dough and cut out as many circles as possible. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
                    </li>
         <li> <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>

            Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool before serving.
